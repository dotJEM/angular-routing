        Routes is primarily used to connect states to urls, the route API is almost identical to the
        ngRoute api with a few additional features.

                <h2>Parameter Converters</h2>

                <p>Through parameter converters, routes can be much more specific.</p>

                <p>E.g. if only numeric id's should be allowed the <code>num</code> converter can be used to only
                    let numeric values pass.

                <h2>State Activators</h2>

                <p>While states can be activated through routes by using the <code>route</code> property.</p>

                <p>If multiple routes should lead to the same state a route can simply define the <code>state</code>
                    property as well.</p>

                <h2>Decorators</h2>

                <p>Decorators can be registered to alter routes before they update events are broad casted.</p>

                <p>This allows for altering the outgoing route objects.</p>

        <h1>Route Configuration</h1>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h3><code>demo.js</code></h3>

                <p>The following example shows a small application with four states.</p>

                <p>
                    In addition to the states two extra alternative routes has been configured,
                    one for the <code>about</code> state and one for the <code>contact</code> state.
                    Each state is configured in the root and all targets the same view called 'main'.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It also configures a parameter converter than is used to only accept parameters
                    within a given numeric range.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally it defaults to the route <code>/404</code> if none of the defined routes are matched.
                </p>

                <h3><code>home.html</code></h3>

                <p>
                    In the <code>home.html</code> template we have added a number of extra links to the page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since we are activating states though their alternative routes we can't use the <code>sref</code>
                    directive here since that would obviously pick the primary route of each state.

                    So instead the links are hardcoded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are two valid links as well as two invalid ones. Clicking the valid ones will correctly
                    bring us to the desired states, however if we click the invalid ones we go to the <code>404</code>
                    page.
                </p>

                <h3>Scenarios</h3>

                <p>
                    Configuring alternative routes can be used to provide short-hand routes or keep old
                    routes that has been replaced in an application active.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In both cases a redirection might be more suited however, which is achieved though the same API.
